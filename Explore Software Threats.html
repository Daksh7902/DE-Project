            <h2>üõ°Ô∏è Understanding Software Threats</h2>
            <p>
                Software threats are harmful programs or codes designed to damage computers, steal personal data,
                or misuse system resources. These threats can come from emails, downloads, websites, or even
                infected devices. Understanding them helps you stay safe in the digital world.
            </p>

            <h3>Types of Software Threats</h3>

            <div class="threat-list">

                <div class="threat-item">
                <h4>1. Malware</h4>
                <p>
                    Malware (short for ‚Äúmalicious software‚Äù) is any program designed to damage, disrupt, or steal information
                    from your computer system. It includes viruses, worms, and trojans.
                    <br><br>
                    Malware poses serious problems to individuals and businesses on the Internet.According to Symantec's 2018 Internet Security Threat Report (ISTR), malware variants number has increased to 669,947,865 in 2017, which is twice as many malware variants as in 2016.Cybercrime, which includes malware attacks as well as other crimes committed by computer, was predicted to cost the world economy US$6 trillion in 2021, and is increasing at a rate of 15% per year.Since 2021, malware has been designed to target computer systems that run critical infrastructure such as the electricity distribution network.

                <h4>2. Virus</h4>
                <p>
                    A computer virus attaches itself to legitimate programs and spreads when the infected program runs.
                    It can delete files, slow down the system, or corrupt data.
                    <br><br>
                    Computer viruses generally require a host program.The virus writes its own code into the host program. When the program runs, the written virus program is executed first, causing infection and damage. By contrast, a computer worm does not need a host program, as it is an independent program or code chunk. Therefore, it is not restricted by the host program, but can run independently and actively carry out attacks.

                <h4>3. Worm</h4>
                <p>
                    A worm is a self-replicating program that spreads through networks, often consuming bandwidth
                    and slowing systems.
                    <br><br>
                    Many worms are designed only to spread, and do not attempt to change the systems they pass through. However, as the Morris worm and Mydoom showed, even these "payload-free" worms can cause major disruption by increasing network traffic and other unintended effects.

                <div class="threat-item">
                <h4>4. Trojan Horse</h4>
                <p>
                    A trojan hides inside a legitimate program but secretly performs malicious actions like data theft.
                    <br><br>
                    Trojans are generally spread by some form of social engineering. For example, a user may be duped into executing an email attachment disguised to appear innocuous (e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or into clicking on a fake advertisement on the Internet. Although their payload can be anything, many modern forms act as a backdoor, contacting a controller who can then have unauthorized access to the affected device.Ransomware attacks are often carried out using a trojan

                <h4>5. Ransomware</h4>
                <p>
                    Ransomware locks or encrypts your files and demands payment to unlock them. It often spreads
                    through phishing emails or fake downloads.
                    <br><br>
                    Ransomware attacks are typically carried out using a Trojan disguised as a legitimate file that the user is tricked into downloading or opening when it arrives as an email attachment. However, one high-profile example, the WannaCry worm, traveled automatically between computers without user interaction.[6]

                <h4>6. Spyware</h4>
                <p>
                    Spyware secretly monitors your online activity and collects personal information like passwords or banking data.
                    <br><br>
                    Spyware is frequently associated with advertising and involves many of the same issues. Because these behaviors are so common, and can have non-harmful uses, providing a precise definition of spyware is a difficult task.

                <div class="threat-item">
                <h4>7. Adware</h4>
                <p>
                    Adware automatically displays or downloads unwanted advertisements. It‚Äôs not always dangerous
                    but can slow down systems or collect browsing data.
                    <br><br>
                    The software may generate two types of revenue: one is for the display of the advertisement and another on a "pay-per-click" basis, if the user clicks on the advertisement. Some advertisements also act as spyware,[1] collecting and reporting data about the user, to be sold or used for targeted advertising or user profiling. The software may implement advertisements in a variety of ways, including a static box display, a banner display, a full screen, a video, a pop-up ad or in some other form. All forms of advertising carry health, ethical, privacy and security risks for users.

                <h4>8. Rootkit</h4>
                <p>
                    Rootkits hide deep inside your operating system, giving attackers control over your computer
                    without your knowledge.
                    <br><br>
                    Rootkit installation can be automated, or an attacker can install it after having obtained root or administrator access.[3] Obtaining this access is a result of direct attack on a system, i.e. exploiting a vulnerability (such as privilege escalation) or a password (obtained by cracking or social engineering tactics like "phishing"). Once installed, it becomes possible to hide the intrusion as well as to maintain privileged access. Full control over a system means that existing software can be modified, including software that might otherwise be used to detect or circumvent it.

                <h4>9. Keylogger</h4>
                <p>
                    Keyloggers record everything you type (like passwords or messages) and send the information
                    to cybercriminals.
                    <br><br>
                    While the programs themselves are legal,[3] with many designed to allow employers to oversee the use of their computers, keyloggers are most often used for stealing passwords and other confidential information.[4][5] Keystroke logging can also be utilized to monitor activities of children in schools or at home and by law enforcement officials to investigate malicious usage.

                <h4>10. Phishing</h4>
                <p>
                    Phishing uses fake emails or websites to trick users into revealing personal data such as passwords
                    or credit card numbers.
                    <br><br>
                    Modern phishing campaigns increasingly target multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems, not just passwords. Attackers use spoofed login pages and real-time relay tools to capture both credentials and one-time passcodes. In some cases, phishing kits are designed to bypass 2FA by immediately forwarding stolen credentials to the attacker's server, enabling instant access. A 2024 blog post by Microsoft Entra highlighted the rise of adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing attacks, which intercept session tokens and allow attackers to authenticate as the victim
